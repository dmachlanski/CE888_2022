# Datasets for the Causal Inference project

There are two datasets provided for the project: IHDP and JOBS.

Both datasets are supplied in '.npz' and '.csv' file formats. Both formats contain **exactly the same** data. For instance, ihdp.npz contains the same data as ihdp.csv. It is up to you which file format you choose to use (whichever you prefer).
